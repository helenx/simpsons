# Simpsons Database
Create a database of Simpsons episode transcripts for analysis using Python and SQL

## Getting Started
To build your Simpsons dataset, you'll need to find a comprehensive source with episode scripts available and do some web scraping. [Simpsons World on FXX](https://www.simpsonsworld.com/) provided the most accessible material, which I pulled and stored in a PostgreSQL database.

- A detailed rundown on how to create the database and query it can be found in [simpsons_world_script_db.ipynb](https://github.com/helenx/simpsons/blob/master/simpsons_world_script_db.ipynb)
- Some basic analysis on character lines by episode and season can be foudn in [simpsons_character_lines.ipynb](https://github.com/helenx/simpsons/blob/master/simpsons_character_lines.ipynb)

## Projects
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that help you create your Simpsons database and run some basic queries for analysis. This is a fun dataset for Simpsons fans to go through, as you'll often run into your favorite jokes from the show.

Some future projects involving natural language processing and data visualization methods are in the works.
